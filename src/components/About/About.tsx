   Chimas is Born and raised in Eastern Nigeria within a devout Christian family, Chimas discovered his passion for music at an early age, inspired by the rich gospel sounds that shaped his spiritual foundation. Surrounded by the harmonies of church choirs and the powerful messages of faith-driven songs, he began to nurture his musical gift with a strong desire to uplift and inspire others through sound. This passion would soon evolve into a calling—one that transcends performance and speaks directly to the soul.
